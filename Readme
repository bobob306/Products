Hi Nabhan, and possibly Alex and Adam,

I've tried to strike a balance in my comments between informative and espousing my views!
I'm aware that you mentioned there is not much kotlin experience on the team, so I have added a lot of comments, possibly explaining some parts in more detail than is necessary.
On the other hand I may have taken for granted some knowledge, so maybe we can talk this through later on?

I've gone for a very clean and fairly basic app architecture so that you can see how I code, rather than including loads of features which to be honest would also be just as standard as the architecture
Let me know if you'd like to see some more features e.g. adding more or editing current items in the database

I've filled the database using a file hosted on amazonws, this is just because it is something I think you mentioned in the interview

Just for a list of techniques/elements I've used
Dependency injection with dagger hilt
    -   implements a RESTful API to take data from network
    -   provides reusable components that can be used throughout application with as few specific parts as possible
    -   the way it is setup means if there is some data cached the app will work offline, I believe that is helpful for the full fibre application
MVVM architecture with repository
    -   to communicate between the ui and the data stored in the database
DataBinding
    -   to fill the ui with updating data from the viewmodel
Fragments in activities
    -   as the ui with navigation and data passing between fragments
Room Database
    -   to store, access and manipulate data
Preferences manager
    -   to store preferences expressed in the ui between the app opening and closing

On the design side, I haven't added many comments because there isn't a lot to say because you can just see it so easily!
I hope the card design is something you like, but I could send you a row design instead.
In that case I would include a little bit of the desc and use a short function to include the first 50-100 chars.
I like to have rounded corners on my cards
I haven't made many other style choices
